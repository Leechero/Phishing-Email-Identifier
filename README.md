## How To Spot Phishing Emails

- Check the Sender's Email Address: Look for odd domains or misspellings (e.g. support@link3dln.com instead of support@linkedin.com).
- Analyze the Subject line: Phishing Email's often use vague or alarming subjects like "URGENT: ACCOUNT SUSPENDED" to provoke panic.
- Evaluate the Greeting: Generic greetings like "Dear Customer" or "Dear Sir/Ma" are red flags. Legitimate companies usually use your name and if internal use your ID number or job description along with your name.
- Inspect Attachments and links: Unsolicitied attachments with strange file names or formats (like .exe, .scr or .zip) can contain malware. Hover over embedded links to reveal the URL if it looks too sketchy or doesn't match the sender don't click on it.
- Review Spelling and Grammar: Many Phishing Email's contain typos or awkward phrasing. Professional organizations rarely make such mistakes.
